# Project3 COP3530
This repository has a Nonprofit generator which is a user based program that has a dataset of over 800,000 IRS registered nonprofit organizations that meet the updated NTEE code standards. The top 100 nonprofits are outputted to the user based on the preferences or the name of the nonprofit that the user inputs. The SFML Library is used for the user interface and C++ is used for programming this project.

The Command_Line_Version folder in this repository contains files to run our program in the command line interface.

The SFML_Version folder in this repository contains files to run our program in an SFML-based interface. For best performance, type inputs exactly, do not attempt to backspace, and run each kind of search (map/heap/AVL tree) only once per program run.
